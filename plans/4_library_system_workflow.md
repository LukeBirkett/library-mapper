# Library Information System Implementation Workflow

## Definition

The Library Information System is the core component of our application that manages all library-related data and operations. It serves as a centralized system for:

1. **Data Management**
   - Storing library information (locations, hours, facilities)
   - Managing media content (photos, documents)
   - Tracking user contributions and interactions

2. **Community Engagement**
   - Enabling users to add and update library information
   - Collecting user ratings and reviews
   - Facilitating information sharing

3. **Information Access**
   - Providing searchable library data
   - Supporting map-based discovery
   - Delivering filtered and sorted results

We are building this system to:
- Democratize information about London's libraries
- Create a reliable, community-driven database
- Enable easy discovery of library locations and services
- Encourage library visits through better information access
- Support community engagement with local libraries

This system forms the backbone of our application, connecting the User Management System with the frontend map interface and providing the data structure needed for all library-related features.

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of the Library Information System, building upon our existing User Management System.

## Prerequisites
- ✅ User Management System implemented
- ✅ MongoDB connection established
- ✅ Authentication middleware working
- ✅ Library model created
- ✅ Test cases prepared

## Implementation Phases

### 1. Library Controller Setup
- [✅] Basic CRUD Operations
  - [✅] Create library entry
  - [✅] Read library information
  - [✅] Update library details
  - [✅] Delete library entry

- [🔜] Advanced Operations
  - [🔜] Search functionality
  - [🔜] Geolocation queries
  - [🔜] Filtering options
  - [🔜] Pagination

### 2. Route Implementation
- [✅] Public Routes
  - [✅] Get all libraries
  - [✅] Get single library
  - [🔜] Search libraries
  - [🔜] Filter by location/borough

- [✅] Protected Routes
  - [✅] Create library
  - [✅] Update library
  - [✅] Delete library
  - [📸] Add photos (See: 5_photo_implementation.md)

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- [✅] Middleware Integration
  - [✅] Protect routes
  - [✅] Verify user permissions
  - [✅] Handle token validation

- [ ] User Contribution Tracking
  - [✅] Update user's contribution list
  - [ ] Track library modifications
  - [📸] Handle photo uploads (See: 5_photo_implementation.md)

### 4. Data Validation & Error Handling
- [ ] Input Validation
  - [ ] Required fields
  - [ ] Data format
  - [ ] Coordinate validation

- [ ] Error Responses
  - [ ] Validation errors
  - [✅] Authentication errors
  - [✅] Not found errors
  - [✅] Server errors

### 5. Testing & Verification
- [ ] Unit Tests
  - [ ] Controller functions
  - [ ] Middleware
  - [ ] Model methods

- [ ] Integration Tests
  - [ ] API endpoints
  - [ ] Authentication flow
  - [ ] Data persistence

- [ ] Error Case Testing
  - [ ] Invalid data
  - [✅] Unauthorized access
  - [ ] Missing fields

## Testing Checklist
Each feature should be tested for:
- ⚡ Success cases
- ❌ Error cases
- 🔒 Authentication
- 🔍 Data validation
- 📝 Database updates

## Next Steps
After completing each phase:
1. Update documentation
2. Review test coverage
3. Plan next phase
4. Track progress in this document

## Notes
- Keep checking against technical-architecture.md for consistency
- Update test scripts as new features are added
- Document any deviations from original plan
