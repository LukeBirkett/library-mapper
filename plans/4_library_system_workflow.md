- üìù Database updates

## Next Steps
After completing each phase:
1. Update documentation
2. Review test coverage
3. Plan next phase
4. Track progress in this document

## Notes
- Keep checking against technical-architecture.md for consistency
- Update test scripts as new features are added
- Document any deviations from original plan
