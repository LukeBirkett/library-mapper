# Project Goal:

This aim of this project is to create an online space to democratize the compilation and sharing of information relating to libraries in London. In itâ€™s most basic form, the website should hold a map showing libraries in London. Information about these libraries should be entirely contributed by members who sign up to the website. Informations might include; pictures, descriptions, comments, questions, guides, events and ratings. The website will be used by people who are passionate about libraries and who want to visit libraries. As a whole, the information compiled on this website should encourage more people to visit libraries.
